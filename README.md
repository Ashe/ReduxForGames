# Alacrity Redux

![Preview](img/preview.gif)

## What is this?
A remake of my [assignment, Alacrity](https://aas.sh/projects/alacrity) made in my own engine. The original project was built using skeleton code provided by the university and we just added game code on top, but I wasn't satisfied with not knowing how the most important parts of the program were created, so I made this project to experience the engine side of the project.

## Dependencies
- SDL2
- GLM
- GLEW
- SOIL

## Bugs? Yes.
This game is a port from an assignment I worked on with DirectX. I am simply reusing the code to test if it works - turns out it does, but I didn't port the entirety of the game code since I only wanted to test the engine.
